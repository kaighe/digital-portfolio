This is a tool I made in order to help me in my Math 122 class to help me create truth tables for logical expressions. It was written in JavaScript and uses a lexer that I made with little knowledge on the subject (I was in a hurry so its quite poorly written) to create an abstract syntax tree in JSON format, which can them be easily run with every true/false combination of variables to create the table.
