This is probably one of my favorite projects. Its a fighting game where you use french insults to deal damage. I made it as an assignment for my grade 11 french class in around 1 month. It supports online multiplayer with a code system to join lobbies. I think the reason I love this project so much is because it can be used in an educational environment, and seeing my project being used to help others is really nice. Unfortunatly, I cant afford to keep the servers running myself, so the game is not playable at the moment.

Just as a side note, this game was not originally written in Javascript, I just compiled a web version. It was made using [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en/gamemaker), Which uses a language called GML that is very similar to Javascript, but with some minor differences.
