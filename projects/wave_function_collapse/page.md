# Wave Function Collapse

This project was one that I made without the help of any outside sources, and it was made mostly just to challenge myself. It is my interpretation of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm, for more information on what that means, see the Github page linked above. In short, the program takes an example bitmap/image and produces variations of that image that follow the same "rules" that were used in the creation of the input.
