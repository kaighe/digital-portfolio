I call this website useless for good reason, as I originally intended to submit it to [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/), a site that me and my friends used to enjoy exploring as kids.

The second reason I made this site was to teach myself JavaScript, making this the first JavaScript program that I wrote. It uses `three.js` for the 3D graphics.
